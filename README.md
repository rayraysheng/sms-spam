SMS Spam Classification project, CMPE255 SP23 Group 11

### Objective
The objective of this project is to build an effective spam detection script using classification methods such as Naive Bayes, Random Forest, SVM, and KNN algorithms. By exploring, evaluating, and implementing these techniques, our aim is to achieve high reliability in identifying spam messages. 

### Instructions
